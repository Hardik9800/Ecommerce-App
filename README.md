# Ecommerce React app

the frontend for an ecommerce website.
We have used the following service to create a dummy ecommerce api service (create good amount of data): https://my-json-server.typicode.com/
# Functionality
## Navbar
- Show cart items count
- Show relevant navigation links
## All products page
- Show list of products from the API (using the above server)
- Each product is editable by clicking on the “pencil” button. And we can edit that product inline. On finish editing the product, show some sort of Alert/Notification
- Each product is deletable, on clicking of the delete button you should delete the product and show some sort of Alert/Notification
- Implement a sort button. On clicking it should sort by “price” and show a cross button just beside it (see the sort view). On clicking the cross button remove the sort.
- Give button to add a product to cart

### Technologies

React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides a declarative way to build complex UIs.

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software applications to communicate with each other. In this case, the React Todo List app is using an API to store and retrieve tasks (Its a Fake apI).
